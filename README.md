##Snake Game

This project is my implementation of a coding challenge to implement the classic video game, Snake. The project is designed to run on a 256x256 pixel LCD screen and has an abstracted API to handle all hardware events such as interfacing with the GPIO, LCD, and system timer. It is designed with standard embedded software practices, i.e. it does not make use of dynamic memory allocation.  My solution was commended for the unique way in which it handles the direction of the next pixel in the snakes's body for every pixel in the snake body, by way of a custom direction encoding scheme.
